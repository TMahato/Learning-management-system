## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java JDK 17** or higher
- **Apache Maven**
- **Git**

---

## Setup and Configuration

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lms.git
cd lms
```

### 2. Configure the Database

The application is configured to use an **H2 in-memory database** by default. If you want to use a persistent database like MySQL, update `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

#### H2 Database (Default)

```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

### 3. Build the Project

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

## Database Connection

If you are using the **H2 in-memory database** (default configuration), you can access the H2 console at:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
- **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: (leave blank)

## Sql Qureies to fetch the Tables

```bash
select * from course;
select * from student;
select * from instructor;
select * from enrollment;
```
